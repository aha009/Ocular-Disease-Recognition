# Ocular-Disease-Recognition

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project focused on ocular disease recognition. The goal of this project is to develop and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately classify ocular images into different disease categories. The models are trained to identify a variety of eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project can be obtained from the following link: 
[Ocular Disease Recognition (ODIR) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k)<br>

About this Dataset

Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) is a structured ophthalmic database consisting of data from 5,000 patients. Each patient's data includes age information, color fundus photographs from the left and right eyes, and diagnostic keywords provided by doctors.

This dataset is intended to represent a "real-life" collection of patient information gathered by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. from various hospitals and medical centers in China. In these institutions, fundus images are captured using various cameras available in the market, such as Canon, Zeiss, and Kowa, resulting in varying image resolutions.
